# MusicalExperiments-Classification
This project, a series of experiments is being conducted to develop deep learning models that can classify small fragments of musical works - what genre it belongs to, what vibe it has, and what part of the song it is. As development progresses, new versions and models will be added with a description of their condition and methods of operation. The results of the experiment with a delay of one version are publicly available here.

## Using
The experiments were carried out using the Google Colaboratory cloud platform. To reproduce the results, you need to run the code blocks in a notebook sequentially, unless the notebook itself says otherwise. For a situation where the program is launched under other conditions, you may need to additionally install libraries: tensorflow, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn and others.

The data set used in the first experiment - transfer learning of the VGG16 model with replacement of the classifier is presented as an archive in the folder Data:
[img_music.zip](Data/img_music.zip).  
This training dataset was taken on the Kaggle platform - [gtzan-dataset-music-genre-classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andradaolteanu/gtzan-dataset-music-genre-classification).

## Documentation
Each experiment was documented in detail; this information is contained directly in the text fields inside the notebooks of each experiment. There you can find recommendations for launching, tips for using code, various notes and limitations in the operation of blocks, and analysis of the results. Before launching notepads, please read the documentation.
